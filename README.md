# Personal Portfolio

Personal portfolio to showcase my works

My name is romaen but I also go by noodles hence "Noodlesjs" :)

## Technology used
This application is built from scratch using html, css and vanilla js.

## Responsive
This application is fully responsive. I enjoyed making my own css structure so the application would be adjusted to any viewport and adapt to new content I add.
Below are some screenshots of the final product.
